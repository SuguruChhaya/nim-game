# nim-game

This is a modified version of the nim game in which users substract numbers from match sticks. If the max increment was 3 (a person could only increase by 1, 2, or 3) and the reaching number was 30, whoever had to say '30' is the loser. I made the increment and the reaching number adjustable by user input with the increment ranging from 3 to 10 and reaching numbers ranging from 20 to 100.
